//Question transform number into their text representation

let numberToBeConverted = 238;
console.log(numberToBeConverted);
numberToBeConverted = numberToBeConverted.toString();
console.log(numberToBeConverted);
//I researched how to check the data type because I could not tell in the console as it showed 238 - w3schools
console.log(typeof numberToBeConverted);
