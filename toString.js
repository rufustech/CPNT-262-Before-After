//Question transform number into their text representation

let number = 238;
console.log("Before - Number" + number);

number = number.toString();

console.log("After conversion to String: " + number, typeof number);
//I researched how to check the data type because I could not tell in the console as it showed 238 - w3schools
// console.log(typeof number);
